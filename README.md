### Abstract
Containerized cloud environments rely on efficient memory management, yet traditional rule-based autoscaling struggles to handle dynamic and unpredictable workloads. This study proposes an intelligent, machine learning–driven framework that continuously monitors runtime memory metrics and predicts future requirements using supervised and reinforcement learning models. By enabling proactive and adaptive memory allocation, the approach avoids both over-provisioning and under-provisioning common in static policies. Integrated with Kubernetes, the framework dynamically adjusts container memory limits without manual intervention. Experimental results show 30–40% improvements in memory utilization efficiency, reduced latency, and fewer SLA violations, demonstrating the effectiveness of ML-based autonomous memory optimization.

### Key Contributions
- **Intelligent Dynamic Memory Optimization Framework:**
  Proposed a machine learning–driven memory optimization architecture for containerized environments that overcomes the limitations of static, rule-based autoscaling through predictive and adaptive resource allocation.
 
- **Continuous Monitoring and Predictive Memory Modeling:**
  Integrated real-time monitoring of container memory utilization, workload intensity, and allocation trends with supervised and reinforcement learning models to forecast future memory requirements accurately.
    
- **Proactive and Autonomous Resource Adjustment:**
  Enabled proactive memory scaling by dynamically adjusting container memory limits before threshold violations occur, reducing reliance on reactive policies and manual intervention.
    
- **Learning-Driven Adaptive Orchestration:**
  Designed a self-learning feedback loop that continuously refines memory allocation decisions based on historical patterns and real-time system behavior, ensuring sustained optimization under fluctuating workloads.
  
### Relevance & Real-World Impact
- **Substantial Improvement in Memory Utilization Efficiency:**
  Achieved up to 30–40% higher memory utilization compared to legacy rule-based autoscaling, significantly reducing idle memory and resource wastage.
    
- **Reduced SLA Violations and Performance Degradation:**
  Proactive memory allocation minimized under-provisioning scenarios, leading to lower latency and improved application stability under dynamic and bursty workloads.
  
- **Cost-Efficient Operation in Multi-Tenant Environments:**
    Lowered operational costs by avoiding over-provisioning, making the framework highly beneficial for shared cloud platforms and enterprise-scale Kubernetes deployments.

- **Scalable and Adaptive Resource Management:**
  Demonstrated consistent performance and utilization gains as cluster size increased, highlighting the framework’s suitability for large-scale, cloud-native infrastructures.
 
- **Production, Research, and Educational Applicability:**
    Provides a modular, platform-agnostic reference framework—covering architecture, learning models, simulations, and empirical validation—suitable for real-world deployment, academic research, and advanced teaching in cloud computing and intelligent systems.
